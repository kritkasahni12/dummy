a)why accelerometer?
proper acceleration; ex when we are sitting :- 1g
when placed on centre of mass, measures net external force acting on subject.
So while walking ; when we raise foot      ->push backward so static friction infwd dirn so peaks in neg z axis
		   when we put foot on grnd->push fwd so static  friction in back dirn so peaks in pos z axis
so we see troughs and peaks in graph.
plus , easily avail in phones these days

So to count steps :
1)when still 
-> stand still for 5 secs

2)then we knw when started moving 
-> diff btw mean std and std of each window in still state;this diff never exceeds 0.07 so started moving ->
 diff exceeds th 0.08 so we know when started moving

3)when step happens?
at every sample k, calculate th and also calc max-acc(k) which if exceeds th -> incr step_count
-> how calc th?
this was done expirementally
"diff" (diff in magnitudes of pos and neg peaks mentioned in 
a) is plotted against freq of steps-> draw a line through 2 pts which are 2 minimum diff values
so th = a/(i-k) + b => y=mx+c so a and b were calculated and b=3.1541 close to pie

4)time between successive steps->inevrs of this time is frequency
